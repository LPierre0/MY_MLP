First, I made a simple perceptron to understand how to create neural network from sracth.

The output is an image of Charmander or Charmeleon with the prediction of the perceptron at the top left.
It's hard to have a good accuracy because the two pokemon are very similar but I've tried between Jigglypuff and Pikachu and the results were better.
